The objective of the thesis is to forecast the Free Cash Flow for one year (2024).
Free Cash Flow is one of the pillars for valuing a company. This aids in the decision-making process for buying/selling shares of companies listed on the stock exchange.

I am using data from 2011 to 2022 for training and 2023 for testing, and forecasting from the second half of 2023 to 2024.
